We welcome contributions! To maintain the integrity and ownership of the protocol, please follow these guidelines:

* **Human-First Logic:** All core architectural decisions, protocol designs, and initial implementations must be authored by humans.
* **Assisted Development:** AI can be used to redo, port, or refactor existing human-written logic, and it is advised to use AI for generating documentation and issues.
* **Transparency:** When submitting a Pull Request, please note if AI was used for scaffolding or refactoring to help maintain clear attribution history.
